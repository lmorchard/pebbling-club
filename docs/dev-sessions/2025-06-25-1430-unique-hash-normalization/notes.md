# Unique Hash Normalization - Implementation Notes

## Session Start

Started: 2025-06-25 14:30
Branch: unique-hash-normalization

## Implementation Details

### URLNormalizer Class Implementation

- Created instance-based URLNormalizer class in `services.py`
- Implemented comprehensive URL normalization:
  - Hostname lowercasing and default port removal
  - Path normalization (trailing slash removal)
  - Query parameter alphabetical sorting
  - Empty query parameter removal
  - Tracking parameter removal (utm\_\*, fbclid, gclid, msclkid, twclid, ref, referrer)
- Used SHA-256 for improved security over SHA-1
- Added proper error handling with logging fallbacks

### Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite with 7 test cases
- Used spec URLs from original Node.js implementation
- All tests passing including edge cases and error handling

### BookmarkManager Integration

- Updated `generate_unique_hash_for_url` to use URLNormalizer
- Maintained backward compatible API

### Database Migration

- Created data migration 0010 with atomic=False for individual transactions
- Processed 30,794 bookmarks successfully
- Found and merged multiple duplicates (kept newer, deleted older)
- Comprehensive logging with JSON deletion records for recovery
- Migration completed without errors

## Issues Encountered

### Test Compatibility

- One existing test expected old SHA-1 hash format
- **Resolution**: Updated test with correct SHA-256 hash from new normalizer

### Migration Design

- Original plan for batched processing complicated by duplicate detection needs
- **Resolution**: Switched to bookmark-by-bookmark processing with IntegrityError handling

## Final Summary

**âœ… Implementation Completed Successfully**

- **URLNormalizer class**: Fully implemented with all normalization rules
- **Migration**: Successfully processed 30,794 real bookmarks
- **Duplicate Detection**: Found and properly merged duplicate bookmarks
- **Testing**: All tests passing (74/74, 11 skipped)
- **Code Quality**: All linting checks pass (black, djlint, mypy)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments

**Key Achievements:**

1. Improved bookmark deduplication through URL normalization
2. Enhanced security with SHA-256 hashing
3. Preserved all original user URLs while normalizing for hashing
4. Comprehensive logging for audit and recovery purposes
5. Robust error handling throughout the system
