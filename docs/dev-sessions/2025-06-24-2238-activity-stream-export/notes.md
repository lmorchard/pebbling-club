# Activity Stream Export - Session Notes

## Session Start
Date: 2025-06-24 22:38
Branch: activity-stream-export

## Progress Notes

### Phase 1: Core Export Foundation
- Successfully implemented ActivityStreamSerializer with proper JSON-LD context
- Created StreamingJSONResponse for memory-efficient large exports  
- Built basic export view following existing Netscape export patterns
- Added URL routing and verified basic functionality

### Phase 2: Export Filtering
- Implemented parameter validation matching Netscape export exactly
- Added support for tag, since, and limit filtering with proper error handling
- Integrated filtering with performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Import Foundation  
- Created comprehensive deserialization methods with validation
- Implemented core import view with transaction management
- Added proper conflict resolution using update_or_create
- Set up URL routing for import endpoint

### Phase 4: Import Options & Testing
- Added skip-duplicates option with flexible parameter handling
- Created extensive test suite with 10 test methods covering all scenarios
- Implemented production-ready optimizations and security measures

## Issues Encountered

### StreamingJSONResponse Generator Issue
- Initial implementation passed function instead of generator to StreamingHttpResponse
- **Solution**: Fixed by calling generate() and updating type annotations

### MyPy Type Annotation Errors
- Several type annotation issues with Dict assignments and imports
- **Solution**: Added explicit type annotations and ignored external library imports

### Test Data Model Complexity
- Needed to handle tag ownership and many-to-many relationships properly
- **Solution**: Used proper test setup with tag creation and association

### Test Failures After Initial Implementation
- Two tests failed: error cases expected 200 but got 400, empty string vs None for descriptions
- **Solution**: Fixed status code logic to return 200 for partial success, fixed empty string handling in serialization

## Technical Decisions

### Data Model Mapping
- Used W3C ActivityStreams standard with custom JSON-LD context for feedUrl
- Prioritized user-created data for perfect roundtrip fidelity
- Mapped unfurl_metadata to standard ActivityStream properties where possible

### Performance Strategy
- Implemented database iterator with dynamic chunk sizing
- Used batch processing for imports with transaction management
- Added comprehensive logging for monitoring large operations

### Security Measures
- Added DoS protection with 50MB request limit and 10K item limit
- Implemented proper input validation and sanitization
- Used structured error responses without information leakage

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented a complete ActivityStream import/export system for bookmarks with:

**✅ Full Compliance**: JSON-LD ActivityStreams specification with custom extensions
**✅ Perfect Roundtrip**: All user-created data preserved exactly during export/import cycles  
**✅ Production Ready**: DoS protection, batch processing, performance monitoring
**✅ Comprehensive Testing**: 10 test methods covering all scenarios including unicode and error cases
**✅ Performance Optimized**: Memory-efficient streaming, dynamic chunking, database optimization

The implementation follows all existing patterns in the codebase, maintains security best practices, and provides a robust foundation for bookmark interoperability. Ready for immediate use without feature flags.

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /bookmarks/export/activitystream.json?tag=python&since=7d&limit=100`
- `POST /bookmarks/import/activitystream/?skip_duplicates=true`

**Files Modified/Created**:
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/serializers.py` (new)
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/streaming.py` (new) 
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/views.py` (enhanced)
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/urls.py` (enhanced)
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/tests/test_activitystream.py` (new)

Session completed successfully with all requirements met and production-ready implementation delivered. All 67 tests pass, including comprehensive ActivityStream test suite covering roundtrip fidelity, error handling, unicode support, and edge cases.
