# Session Notes: Netscape HTML Bookmark Export

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Netscape HTML bookmark export feature for the pebbling-club application. The implementation includes:

### Features Implemented
1. **Export endpoint** at `/bookmarks/export/netscape.html` that generates properly formatted Netscape bookmark files
2. **Streaming response** for memory-efficient handling of large bookmark collections
3. **Complete data mapping** including:
   - URLs, titles, descriptions
   - Creation and modification timestamps
   - Tags (comma-separated)
   - Feed URLs from unfurl metadata
   - Unique hash IDs
4. **Query parameter filtering**:
   - `?tag=python&tag=django` - Filter by multiple tags (ALL required)
   - `?since=7d` - Filter by relative date range
   - `?limit=100` - Limit number of bookmarks
5. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Prefetch tags to avoid N+1 queries
   - Use queryset iterator for memory efficiency
6. **Security features**:
   - Authentication required
   - Activity logging
   - Proper HTML escaping
7. **Comprehensive test suite** with 21 tests covering all functionality

### Technical Approach
- Used Django's `StreamingHttpResponse` for efficient large exports
- Created separate `NetscapeBookmarkExporter` class for clean separation of concerns
- Implemented generator functions for memory-efficient streaming
- Added proper error handling with 400 responses for invalid parameters
- Used Django's built-in HTML escaping for security

### Files Created/Modified
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/exporters.py` - New exporter class
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/views.py` - Added export view
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/urls.py` - Added URL pattern
- `pebbling_apps/bookmarks/tests/test_export.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Commits Made
1. Foundation: Basic view structure and URL routing
2. Basic export: Streaming response with bookmark formatting
3. Enhanced data: Tags, descriptions, and feed URL support
4. Query parameters: Filtering by tags, date, and limit
5. Performance: Query optimization and activity logging
6. Testing: Complete test coverage
7. Fix: CustomUser compatibility in tests

The implementation follows Django best practices and is ready for production use.
