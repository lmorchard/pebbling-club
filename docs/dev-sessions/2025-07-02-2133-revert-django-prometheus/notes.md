- `pebbling_apps/feeds/models.py` - Feed and FeedItem models  
- `pebbling_apps/users/models.py` - CustomUser model
- `pebbling_apps/inbox/models.py` - InboxItem model (added later)
- `pebbling_apps/mastodon_integration/models.py` - MastodonPost model (added later)

**Custom Metrics Modules:**

## Learnings

### Technical Insights

**Django-Prometheus Integration Scope:**
- The original integration was more extensive than initially expected
- Beyond the original commit, prometheus metrics had been added to newer features (inbox, mastodon integration)
- Total removal required touching 40+ files across the entire codebase

**Integration Pattern Analysis:**
- **Model Layer**: ExportModelOperationsMixin was the primary integration point for automatic CRUD metrics
- **Service Layer**: Custom metrics were manually integrated into business logic (feeds, bookmarks, inbox)
- **Infrastructure**: Deep integration with Django settings, middleware, and URL routing
- **Development Tools**: Comprehensive testing and management commands were built around metrics

**Removal Complexity:**
- Systematic approach essential - removing infrastructure before dependencies prevented import errors
- Database backend changes were straightforward but critical
- Custom metrics modules could be completely deleted vs. needing selective removal
- Middleware order was important during original implementation, so removal order mattered

### Lessons Learned for Future Metrics Implementation

**Architectural Considerations:**
- **Stateless vs Stateful**: django-prometheus's in-process storage is incompatible with stateless deployments
- **Alternative Options**: Future metrics should use external storage (Redis, external Prometheus) or push-based metrics
- **Decoupling**: Consider metrics as a separate concern that can be disabled/removed without affecting core functionality

**Integration Lessons:**
- **Gradual Integration**: The original integration added metrics throughout the codebase incrementally
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment variables for controlling metrics collection was a good pattern
- **Error Handling**: Safe metrics operation decorators prevented metrics from breaking core functionality

**Removal Strategy Insights:**
- **Documentation Importance**: Having detailed dev session notes made removal much easier
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite gave confidence that removal didn't break functionality
- **Version Control**: Each step committed separately allowed for easy rollback if needed

### Gotchas and Challenges

**Discovery Phase:**
- Metrics had been added beyond the original commit - required comprehensive search
- Migration files contained prometheus references (expected, don't modify migrations)
- Some business logic had become dependent on metrics modules for imports

**Technical Challenges:**
- **Import Dependencies**: Had to remove metrics imports before deleting metrics files
- **Middleware Order**: Proper middleware configuration required specific positioning
- **Database Backends**: Multiple database configurations needed individual attention
- **Code Formatting**: Automatic removal created formatting issues that needed cleanup
- **Migration Files**: Generated migrations contained package imports that failed after dependency removal

**Testing Considerations:**
- Full test suite was critical for validating removal
- Server startup testing confirmed middleware changes worked
- Endpoint testing verified /metrics was completely removed

### Recommendations for Future Development

**For Metrics Integration:**
1. Choose metrics solutions compatible with deployment architecture upfront
2. Design metrics as an optional, decoupled system
3. Use feature flags or environment variables for complete disable capability
4. Avoid deep integration into core business logic

**For Feature Removal:**
1. Always document integration patterns during implementation
2. Use systematic, phased approach for complex removals
3. Commit each phase separately for rollback capability
4. Run comprehensive tests after each major change
5. Consider automated tooling for finding integration points
6. **Check migration files** - Generated migrations may contain package imports that need manual cleanup

**For Team Coordination:**
1. Document removal process for team awareness
2. Consider deprecation warnings before removal
3. Plan removal during low-activity periods
4. Have rollback plan ready

## Final Summary
