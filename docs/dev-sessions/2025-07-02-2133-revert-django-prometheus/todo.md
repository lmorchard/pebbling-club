# Session Todo: Revert Django Prometheus

## Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis
- [x] **1.1** Examine original integration commit (7099531e620b20c0b1eb8be3826ee4c7ea7c0c4c)
- [x] **1.2** Search current codebase for all django-prometheus references
- [x] **1.3** Create comprehensive removal inventory by category

## Phase 2: Staged Removal
- [x] **2.1** Remove model/database instrumentation
- [x] **2.2** Remove view/business logic instrumentation  
- [ ] **2.3** Remove middleware configuration
- [ ] **2.4** Remove URL/routing configuration
- [ ] **2.5** Remove settings/configuration
- [ ] **2.6** Remove dependencies

## Phase 3: Verification and Cleanup
- [x] **3.1** Final verification (tests, linting, functionality)
- [x] **3.2** Documentation and cleanup

## Testing Checkpoints
- [x] Test after each removal step
- [x] Full test suite after major milestones
- [x] Final comprehensive verification

## Completed
**Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis**
- ✅ Examined original commit and documented integration patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive codebase search revealed scope beyond original commit  
- ✅ Created detailed removal inventory across 8 categories

**Phase 2: Staged Removal**
- ✅ Model/database instrumentation removed (8 model classes cleaned)
- ✅ View/business logic instrumentation removed (6 service/task files)
- ✅ Middleware configuration removed (PrometheusBeforeMiddleware, PrometheusAfterMiddleware)
- ✅ URL/routing configuration removed (/metrics endpoint deleted)
- ✅ Settings/configuration removed (INSTALLED_APPS, environment variables)
- ✅ Dependencies removed (pyproject.toml, uv.lock updated)

**Phase 3: Verification and Cleanup**
- ✅ All custom metrics files deleted (6 files total)
- ✅ Makefile metrics commands removed
- ✅ Comprehensive testing: 137 tests pass, Django check clean
- ✅ /metrics endpoint returns 404, server starts successfully
- ✅ Complete documentation with lessons learned and recommendations

**Final Result:** Application successfully reverted to clean state with no django-prometheus integration remaining.
