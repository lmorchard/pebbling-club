# Django Debug Toolbar Installation - Implementation Notes

## Summary

Successfully installed and configured django-debug-toolbar version 5.2.0 in the Pebbling Club project. The toolbar is now available for debugging database queries and other development tasks in local development environments.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `django-debug-toolbar>=5.1.0` to pyproject.toml
- Installed version 5.2.0 via `uv sync`

### 2. Django Settings Configuration
- Added `debug_toolbar` to INSTALLED_APPS conditionally when DEBUG=True
- Inserted `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` into MIDDLEWARE list
  - Positioned after SecurityMiddleware but before WhiteNoise middleware
  - Only active when DEBUG=True
- INTERNAL_IPS was already properly configured with ["127.0.0.1"]

### 3. URL Configuration
- Added conditional import of debug_toolbar in pebbling/urls.py
- Configured debug toolbar URLs at `__debug__/` path
- URLs only included when settings.DEBUG is True

## Testing Instructions

To verify the installation:

1. Ensure DEBUG=True in your .env file
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
3. Visit any page in the application (e.g., http://localhost:8000/)
4. Look for the debug toolbar tab on the right side of the page
5. Click to expand the toolbar and verify panels are accessible:
   - SQL Panel (primary focus for debugging empty query results)
   - Time Panel
   - Headers Panel
   - Request Panel
   - Templates Panel
   - Static Files Panel
   - Cache Panel
   - Signals Panel

## Security Considerations

- All debug toolbar functionality is isolated to DEBUG mode only
- No impact on production deployments when DEBUG=False
- INTERNAL_IPS restricts access to localhost only

## Commits Made

1. **Add django-debug-toolbar to project dependencies** (6b8f2be)
   - Added package to pyproject.toml
   - Installed via uv sync

2. **Configure django-debug-toolbar in Django settings** (7d87757)
   - Added to INSTALLED_APPS when DEBUG=True
   - Added middleware in correct position

3. **Add django-debug-toolbar URL configuration** (c327c3a)
   - Added conditional URL patterns
   - Configured at __debug__/ path

## Next Steps

The django-debug-toolbar is now ready for use in debugging database queries that are returning unexpected empty result sets. The SQL panel will show:
- All executed queries
- Query execution time
- EXPLAIN output for queries
- Duplicate query detection

This will help identify why certain queries are returning empty sets when data is expected.
