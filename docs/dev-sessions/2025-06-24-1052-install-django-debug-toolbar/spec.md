# Django Debug Toolbar Installation Specification

## Overview
Install django-debug-toolbar in the Pebbling Club project to provide debugging capabilities during local development, with initial focus on analyzing database queries that are returning unexpected empty result sets.

## Purpose
- **Primary**: Analyze and debug database queries, specifically those returning unexpected empty sets
- **Secondary**: General development debugging including:
  - Performance analysis
  - Query optimization (N+1 queries, slow queries, excessive query counts)
  - Template rendering inspection
  - Request/response debugging

## Requirements

### Environment Configuration
- **Availability**: Local development only
- **Access Control**: No restrictions in local development
- **Security**: No special IP restrictions or authentication required

### Feature Configuration
- Use default django-debug-toolbar configuration
- All default panels should be enabled:
  - SQL Panel (primary focus)
  - Time Panel
  - Headers Panel
  - Request Panel
  - Templates Panel
  - Static Files Panel
  - Cache Panel
  - Signals Panel
  - And any other default panels

### Installation Steps
1. Add django-debug-toolbar to project dependencies
2. Update Django settings for local development:
   - Add to INSTALLED_APPS
   - Add middleware
   - Configure INTERNAL_IPS
   - Add URL patterns
3. Ensure toolbar only loads in DEBUG mode
4. Test toolbar functionality with focus on SQL panel

### Success Criteria
- Toolbar appears in local development environment
- SQL queries are visible and inspectable
- Can view full SQL statements for queries returning empty sets
- No impact on non-development environments
- All default panels are functional

## Future Considerations
- May extend to staging/development servers with appropriate access controls
- May customize panel configuration based on debugging needs
