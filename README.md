## development notes

Trying to jot down notes of needful things before productivity occurs.
Some of this will end up unnecessary after initial commit.

```bash
# create virtual environment (if not already created)
python -m venv venv

# activate virtual environment
. ./venv/bin/activate

# upgrade pip (if needed)
pip install --upgrade pip

# install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When installing packages:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
