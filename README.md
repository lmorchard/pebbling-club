## overall notions

- Sift, seek, save, share... with friends? overall pitch?

## Misc dev notions

- separate concerns of data and logic into repository and service layers
- start each feature as a CLI command first, wherever possible
- write tests mainly for tricky bits of logic, don't need 100% coverage
- think about per-user sqlite databases for profile data?
